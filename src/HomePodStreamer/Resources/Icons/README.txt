Icon Placeholder

You need to create an icon file named "app-icon.ico" in this directory.

You can:
1. Create your own icon using an online tool like: https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Download a free icon from: https://icons8.com/ or https://www.flaticon.com/
3. Use any .ico file you have

For now, the application will run without an icon (or with a default Windows icon).

Recommended icon size: 256x256 pixels or smaller
Format: .ico (Windows Icon format)
